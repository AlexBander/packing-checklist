## Feature requests

This is minimalistic app that has one sole purpose. **It manages the lists of items for your travel packing and allowes you to check items as you pack them.**

Only features that are aligned with the purpose of the app will be considered.

## Key concepts
- `Item` one item that you need to pack (for example: *laptop* or *t-shirt*)
- `List` a collection of `Items` that share some common feature (for example you need them for the winter or you need them if you are renting a car or when you plan to surf, etc...)
- `Checklist` is visually collection of `Items` that you need to pack for specific journy. You can check them one by one. It is also a collection of `Lists` thats you have picket. If there is a `Item` in multiple `Lists` you have picked, it is visible only once.
- When you add `Item` to the `List` (or you remove it from the list) it is automaticlly added to/removed from all non-finished `Checklists` but it stays in finished once.
